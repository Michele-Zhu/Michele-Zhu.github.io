## Hi, I'm Michele Zhu. Nice to meet you.

I'm a PhD student in Information Technologies at Politecnico di Milano. Software nowdays is everywhere, luckly for me I always loved to solve problems and write efficient solution for them. 

I started this blog to share more about myself and get other people to known me better. Below, I'll list some tools that I've used, in the list I'm most familiar with Python and Deep Learning stack. In the sidebar you can find my contact details.
